# corsika-in-ice

This project is a continuation of earlier work by J. Bolmont and T. Sloan to modify the CORSIKA air shower Monte Carlo to operate in ice.  Previous work is documented at: https://astro.desy.de/neutrino_astronomy/icecube/software/corsika_in_ice/index_eng.html
The modified version of CORSIKA here is a straightforward adaptation of J. Bolmont's changes to the latest release v74005.
